Take photos with the camera, add them to your photo library, and display them in your app.

Smile! Click! A lot happens in quick succession when you take a photo. ðŸ“¸

Follow the action after you tap or click the shutter button, to investigate what happens from that moment to when the photo shows up in your photo library.
